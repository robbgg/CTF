Lab03: mini-heartbleed
======================

  This binary mimics the nature of the popular Heartbleed vulnerability
  discovered in 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed). Two
  lessons: 1) attackers can bypass any randomness-based security techniques
  via information leakages, 2) don't trust user's input as it is.
  
  This binary is protected by SSP.
