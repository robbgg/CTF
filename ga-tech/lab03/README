Lab03: protected-stack
----------------------

Miners would carry a bird, canary, down into the mine tunnels. If dangerous gases
collected in the mine, the gases would kill the canary before killing the miners,
avoiding disastrous situations.

To mitigate buffer overflow attacks, canaries have been placed to protect
the return address in the stack. We will explore various forms of canary
schemes in this lab.
