1: Load the shellcode in ENV variable
2: Shellcode = <Address of env variable><Addr of first strcpy><Address of env><Nopsled><Addr of beginning of payload>

The trick is to get the second strcpy to jump back to start of your payload without overwriting everything, the Addr of fiurst strcpy ensures that.
