The file descriptor can be shared with another child process of the parent
We can open the file in parent and make sure that the file descriptor is equal to 3
Since the file descriptor is constant to 3 then the file opened by the assembly 
will have a different file descritpor number than 3, thus the file opened in parent program will be
opended
