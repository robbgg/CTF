We need to change a fixed address in program to badf00d hexvalue.
You can use %hn which overwrites the given address with number of bytes printed till now

Here badf00d = 195948557
but we cannot print out these many number of chars to stdout, so we will break the 
process into lower level and higher level bits and write
bad = 2989
f00d = 61453

A very good explanation is in the link above
