Lab09: kproc-ret2dir
====================

  Unlike VM allows the execution of userspace from the kernel (as you tested
  in the kproc-zeropage), modern hardware implements a defense mechanism,
  called Supervisor Mode Execution Protection (SMEP), which prevents any
  userspace execution in ring 0. However, for some architectures
  including x86-64 (w/ the old Linux kernel), you can still bypass with
  an exploitation technique, called ret2dir.
  
  NOTE. We set physmaps executable for you.
  
  ; insert
  $ sudo insmod kproc.ko
  
  Get the root shell and submit your flag.
