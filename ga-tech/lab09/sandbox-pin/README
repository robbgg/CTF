Lab09: sandbox-pin
==================

  Pin is a dynamic binary instrumentation framework by intel.
  Since Pin can capture and control syscall, one might think making sandbox with pin.
  However, Pin is not for sandboxing, but binary instrumentation.
  So, memory safety is not considered and Pin based sandbox can be easily escaped.
