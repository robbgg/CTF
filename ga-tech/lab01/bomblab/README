In this problem, you task is to defuse the bomb and get the flag.
The binary 'bomb; is an executable that consists of multiple phases.
Each phase expects you th enter a particular string on stdin. If you 
enter the expected string, then the phase is defused. Otherwise, the
the bomb explodes and you get one point deducted. A thorough 
understanding of how 'bomb' works (in binary level) might help you

as it will update your progress (bomb defused/exploded) to the submission 
site, so be careful and not let the bomb explote!
