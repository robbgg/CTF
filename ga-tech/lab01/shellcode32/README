This problem will prepare you to write shellcode on 32 bit architecture,
which is the basics for advanced exploitation. Write a shellcode program
that reads the flag from /proc/flag and submit the flag.

 ; build
 $ make

 ; shellcode to launch
 $ objdump -m i386 -D -b binary shellcode.bin

 ; fire
 $ (cat shellcode.bin; echo;  cat) | ./target
 ...
 cat /proc/flag

 - Unfortunately that is not your flag. Write a payload
   (readflag.S) that directly reads the flag.

 ; run your shellcode
 $ cat readflag.bin | ./target 

 ; submit your flag
 $ submit -l lab01 -p shellcode32 -f <flag-file>

 ; note: you must get your flag through the ./tareget binary
