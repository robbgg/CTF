Lab05: fmtstr-relro
===================

  Overwriting GOT was so convenient. In fact, we can secure
  a target binary by making the GOT region read-only; just
  bind all functions when the binary is about to launch
  and make the region read-only, so called RELRO
  (RELocation Read Only).
  
  What happen when a program terminates?
  
    $ man atexit
  
  Also, you might want to see these source files from glibc:
  exit.c, atexit.c, cxa_atexit.c and sysdep.h
  
  The target binary is:
  
      CANARY    : disabled
      FORTIFY   : disabled
      NX        : ENABLED
      PIE       : disabled
      RELRO     : FULL
