Disclaimer
===========
The following lab and executables have been written and provided
in the course CS6265 at Georgia Institute of Technology in Fall 2015.
The copyright and ownerhsip belongs to teacher's of CS6265 lab please do not distribute 
this work as your own. The payloads and the writeups on how to solve (crack)
each executable have been written by me (author) and I am not responsible for 
the way you use the shellcodes or the knowledge provided in this repository.

If you want to discuss or undertand how to solve the any of the labs, please 
leave me a message on Github, I have compiled some of common things needed to solve
each problem in the repository in the "NOTES" file in the home folder.

You cannot capture the flag in any of the problems as it requires an API key to 
download the flag, but you can check if your shellcode is executed by analysing 
it in GDB.

Welcome to CS 6265 Infosec Lab
------------------------------

Introduction
============

This git repository will be your workspace to solve the labs and
problems for this course. It contains lab materials as well as
some utility scripts to help you with the lab.

The labs and the executables have been tested on ubuntu/trusty32 and ubuntu/trusty64
please follow the setup commands on how to set the lab environment.



Lab Setup
=========
; Install virtualbox
sudo apt-get install virtualbox

; Install vagrant
sudo apt-get install vagrant

; Mac and Windows users can download Virtualbox and vagrant from the
following links:
Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

; Install Ubuntu/trusty32 and Ubuntu/trusty64 images 
vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty32
vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64

; Make separate folders for 32bit and 64bit lab
(32 bit example)
mkdir seclab32

; Initialise vagrant in the folder
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty32

; To start vagrant use
vagrant up

; To log in to the vagrant machine use
vagrant ssh

; Once you are in the VM, install Git and GDB using
sudo apt-get install git
sudp apt-get install gdb

; To get the lab
git clone git@github.com:agupta402/Exploits.git



File layouts
============

The file structure of this repo will look like the following:

$ ls
README		: this file
bin/		: utility scripts
labNN/		: materials for labNN

For each lab, it contains a README file as well as all challenges
as its subdirectories.

$ ls lab01/
README		: information about this lab
bomblab		: challenge bomblab
shellcode32	: challenge shellcode32
...

* Do read those README files as they contain very helpful information
about how to complete each lab and problem, including additional
reference materials and readings.


Commmands
=========

; get new labs and problems
$ git pull

; initialize your environment
; (this only has to be done once if you do not change the machine)
$ ./bin/init


; some of the labs require some preprocessing to be done and will
have init scripts, run the init script before completing the lab
./init.sh
